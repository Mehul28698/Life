# Life
It's soul soothing when you know you are priority of someone.And that she/he is desperate to know what is going on with your life and how are you facing it. It's lifely to feel that someone is constantly making effort for you. It feels abundantly soothing when you're going through some courage breaking moments and suddenly your cell rings leading to that chirping voice, "Heyyy, what's up?" And then you finally let out all the chunk of bullshit going through your head and at the end ,when it's all spoken, you feel heavenly relief after like decades! Won't you?  Life is an unpredictable roller-coster ride. You don't know about it's ups,downs and it's end! But that ride for sure turns out to be an interestingly soothing one,  when you have someone sitting right next to you , clasping your palms tightly , looking straight in your eyes and feeding the support that your desires seek!  Really, have someone whom you can rely upon, someone who converts your hell into adventure land.  Because life becomes more beautiful when it is lived with love in your heart and smile on your mind.
